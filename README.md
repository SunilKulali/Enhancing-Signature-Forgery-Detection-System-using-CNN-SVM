# Enhancing-Signature-Forgery-Detection-System-using-CNN-SVM
This project focuses on developing a system to detect forged signatures. It likely leverages a combination of two machine learning techniques: /br
1.Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 2.Support Vector Machine (SVM) The aim of the project would be to improve the accuracy of signature forgery detection compared to traditional methods.
